# Test-and-trials
This repository will contain python codes in wich I work on. They're all for gaining experince in coding, not big deal. Some will be based on copy-paste ones from others.
I'm new in Github. If you'd like to be in touch with me this is my telegram: @Juan_Pepe_xd
I'd be glad if you could give me any feedback and stuff. 
Greeting from Mexico.
